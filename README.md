# c_practice

Just trying to learn some C for funsies.

CTRL + Z is EOF on windows powershell, but CTRL + D on mac. Remember this so you won't spend ages wondering why your program is not printing the proper output when you press CTRL + C instead (duh). That just kills the program, and if there happens to be any output in the process, that's just by chance.
